This is a PowerBI project. Here I have used power Query to cleaned the raw dataset and have created data visualisations.

** The dataset used is information collected from random people who are working in the data industry which contained questions
related to their current job roles and details related to it. 
** Ive attempted to make sense of the data and have done analysis on their job roles, favourite language, Salary, Satisfaction with salarly & work balance,etc
** I have created an interactive dashboard to show the insights which I have gained through analysis.


**I have also uploaded the raw dataset here.
